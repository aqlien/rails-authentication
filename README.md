Rails Authentication
Author: Alex Quel Lien
====================
This is a sample rails application demonstrating authentication, written without using pre-built authentication gems.
It follows the model laid out by Railscast 250, found [here](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised?view=asciicast).
That Railscast is somewhat outdated, and Rails 4 has new methods to help with authentication. The book found [here](http://www.railstutorial.org/book), Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl, was very helpful in implementing those methods, especially chapters 6 and 8.
